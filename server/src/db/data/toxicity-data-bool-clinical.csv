Poisonings typically occur during periods of high rainfall amounts, after grazing on the rapidly growing young green plants for periods of one week to six months, with an average of 8 weeks.

Affected animals may be unable to go backwards (back up); bladder paralysis can result in over filling and constant dribbling of urine, which can in turn lead to scalding of the hind legs in mares and/or bladder infection. Poisonings may also be associated with fetal deformities or fetal death."
