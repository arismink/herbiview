Poisonings typically occur during periods of high rainfall amounts, after grazing on the rapidly growing young green plants for periods of one week to six months, with an average of 8 weeks. Clinical effects include a loss of nerve function to the hind legs and bladder, stumbling when forced to move, progressing to complete paralysis of the hind limbs. Affected animals may be unable to go backwards (back up); bladder paralysis can result in over filling and constant dribbling of urine, which can in turn lead to scalding of the hind legs in mares and/or bladder infection.
